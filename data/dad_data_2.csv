Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, EKC, is a serious and highly contagious viral eye infection, which lacks effective treatment. EKC can be found all over the world, but is more common in heavily populated countries in Asia, with approximately one million cases of EKC per year in Japan alone.

Adenovir Pharma is developing new solutions for treatment of certain infectious diseases affecting the eyes. The company was founded by researchers at the department of Virology, Umeå University, Sweden and the P.U.L.S. AB network. Adenovir Pharma´s aim is to develop a topical pharmaceutical product against EKC, based their unique proprietary technology; which forces certain viruses to aggregate and inhibit them from binding to and infecting human corneal cells. The product acts outside the human cells, and there is low risk for development of viral resistance.
